This is the abstract. It is set up such that text can be written and \texttt{\textbackslash newabstract\{<content>\}} can be called to produce a block of text on a 0.6 wide minipage.

The abstract has space for around 100 words with the standard spacing and margins. If it is much longer then spacing will need to be changed in order to prevent it overflowing onto the second page.
